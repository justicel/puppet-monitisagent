Deploying a the monitis agent for the monitor.us service using puppet.

Supported CentOS 6 x86

I packaged the monitis agent in an rpm package which is available on http://repository.visibilityspots.com.

Example for node.pp manifest:

node 'HOSTNAME' {
  yumrepo { 'Visibilityspots':
    baseurl  => 'http://repository.visibilityspots.com',
    descr    => 'Visibilityspots repository',
    enabled  => 1,
    gpgcheck => 0
  }
  class {
    'monitis':
      mail      => 'THE EMAIL ADRES OF YOUR MONITOR.US ACCOUNT',
      agentname => 'SPECIFIC NAME OF THE SERVER YOU WANT TO MONITOR';
  }
}

Additionally you can add the api and secret key from your monitor.us account.

  class {
    'monitis':
      mail      => 'THE EMAIL ADRES OF YOUR MONITOR.US ACCOUNT',
      apikey    => 'THE APIKEY PROVIDED BY MONITOR.US (SETTINGS ON MONITOR.US)',
      secretkey => 'THE SECRETKEY PROVIDED BY MONITOR.US (SETTINGS ON MONITOR.US)',
      agentname => 'SPECIFIC NAME OF THE SERVER YOU WANT TO MONITOR';
  }

Feel free to report issue's or comments.
